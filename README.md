This repository contains a simple prototype named `fluently-kids.html` that demonstrates the idea behind **Fluently AI Kids English Tutor**.

## Features
- Designed for children under 10 years old
- Interface available in five languages: English, Español, 한국어, Tagalog and Français
- Difficulty starts at a level based on age and increases as the child progresses
- Uses the browser's speech synthesis and recognition to let kids hear and repeat English words

Open `fluently-kids.html` in a modern browser to explore the prototype. Speech recognition relies on the Web Speech API, which is best supported in Chromium-based browsers.
